Aggregation.sql
	This is the sql query w/ added comments to answer the question about 	aggregating loan data. 	I included 2 queries in this file, the first 	of which groups the aggregations by month and year: 		
		i.e. Jan 2018, Feb 2018, Jan 2020, Feb 2020,…
	The second of which is only grouped by month:
		i.e. Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May,…

JoiningTables.sql
	This is the sql query w/ added comments to answer the question about 	getting loan data of 	“disbursement” transaction type and loan 	status of active or repaid. 

UmbaAnalysis.ipynb
	This is a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code that explores/		visualizes/analyzes the weekly_logins.csv file. I have included 	comments and an explanation of my statistical analysis	methods in 	this file.
